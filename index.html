		<h1>What Our Student says</h1>
		<p>The annual Whatuni Student Choice Awards (WUSCAs) highlight the incredible work carried out by 
		institutions for their students. Due to Covid restrictions, this year’s awards were not collected 
		on uni campuses as usual, but instead based on submissions from institutions, which were then judged 
		by our special student panel.</p>
